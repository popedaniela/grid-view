# grid-view

Grid view project that displays the data from the json file.
You have full creative freedom – so go wild. There’s a catch though!

The project includes:

- Pagination
- A search function
- A ‘no results found’ state on search
- Make it accessible and keyboard friendy
- A form that allows users to add data to the grid. The data is stored in the state so it will be removed when refresh.
